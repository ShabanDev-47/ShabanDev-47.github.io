        Kitchen Fella Is a Kitchen Chaos clone game, Built from scratch. After Finishing Military service I Did this simple game to refresh my memory on game design, and code best practices.

        Pick up some ingredients, prepare them, put them on a plate and deliver them.
        Work with the various counters to prepare them.
        Pick up a full Cheese block, cut it into slices, then cook a Meat Patty (but don't let it burn!), pick them up on a Plate, add some Bread and you have a nice burger!
